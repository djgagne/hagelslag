Hagelslag is an object-based severe storm forecasting system that utilizing image processing and machine learning tools
to derive calibrated probabilities of severe hazards from convection-allowing numerical weather prediction model output.
The package contains modules for storm identification and tracking, spatio-temporal data extraction, and 
machine learning model training to predict hazard intensity as well as space and time translations.

### Requirements

Hagelslag is compatible with Python 3.6 or newer. Hagelslag is easiest to install with the help of the [Miniconda 
Python Distribution](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), but it should work with other
Python setups as well. Hagelslag requires the following packages and recommends the following versions:

* numpy >= 1.10
* scipy >= 0.15
* matplotlib >= 1.4
* scikit-learn >= 0.16
* pandas >= 0.15
* arrow >= 0.8.0
* pyproj
* netCDF4-python
* xarray
* jupyter
* ncepgrib2
* pygrib
* cython
* pip
* sphinx
* mock

Install dependencies with the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/djgagne/hagelslag.git
cd ~/hagelslag
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate hagelslag
```

### Installation
Install the latest version of hagelslag with the following command from the top-level hagelslag directory (where setup.py
is):
`pip install .`


Hagelslag will install the libraries in site-packages and will also install 3 applications into the `bin` directory
of your Python installation.

### Use
A Jupyter notebook is located in the demos directory that showcases the functionality of the package. For larger scale 
use, 3 scripts are provided in the bin directory. 

* `hsdata` performs object tracking and matching as well as data processing.
* `hsfore` trains and applies machine learning models.
* `hseval` performs forecast verification.

All scripts take input from a config file. The config file should be valid Python code and contain a dictionary called
config. Custom machine learning models and parameters should be contained within the config files. Examples of them can
be found in the config directory.

### Documentation
API Documentation is available [here](http://hagelslag.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
